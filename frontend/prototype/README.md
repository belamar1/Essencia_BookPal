# Prototype Collaboration

Welcome to the Prototype Collaboration Project! This project aims to create and refine the design for our application. Below are the guidelines for collaborating, contributing, and keeping the work organized.

## Structure
- Prototype: This is the main folder containing all design-related files and resources.
  - `Logo/`: Contains the project logo in various formats.
  - `Slogan/`: Includes the project's slogan or tagline.
  - InitialTemplates: This folder contains phone mockups for collaborators
  - you may name the branch as fellow : 
    - initialTemplate_Andres
    - initialTemplate_Susan
    - initialTemplate_Busra
    - initialTemplate_Bakhta

## Version Control
We use Git for version control. Here's how to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Create a Branch**: When working on a new feature or design, create a new branch. Use a descriptive name, e.g., `feature-name`, `bugfix-description`, or `design-update`.
3. **Commit Changes**: Regularly commit changes with meaningful messages. This helps others understand your contributions.
4. **Push Changes**: Push your branch to the repository. This makes your work available to the team.
5. **Create Pull Requests**: When you're ready to merge your changes, create a pull request. This ensures code/design reviews and helps maintain quality.

## Collaboration:
- **Communication** discord, google docs and emails
- **Review and Feedback**: When someone creates a pull request, provide constructive feedback to help improve the design. Be open to suggestions from others.
- **Respect Branches**: Avoid making changes directly to the `main` or `master` branch without a pull request and review.

## Additional Resources
- **Design Software**: We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
